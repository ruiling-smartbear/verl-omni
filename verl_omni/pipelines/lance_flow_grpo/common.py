"""Shared constants for the Lance FlowGRPO adapters.

Lance is BAGEL-lineage: vllm-omni's ``LancePipeline`` inherits
``BagelPipeline`` and overrides only model *construction*.  The constants
below are the construction-time differences the training side has to mirror
so that rollout and trainer agree.  They are taken from ``LANCE_DEFAULTS`` in
``vllm_omni/diffusion/models/lance/pipeline_lance.py``.

#: Sigma-schedule shift.  Lance's rollout defaults to 3.5 where BAGEL uses
#: 3.0; a mismatch silently moves every sigma and breaks log-prob parity.

#: Wan2.2 VAE latent geometry.  Lance feeds the latent straight into
#: ``vae2llm`` instead of unfolding a 2x2 patch the way BAGEL does, so
#: ``patch_latent_dim = latent_patch_size**2 * z_channels = 1 * 48``, which
#: matches the released ``vae2llm.weight`` of shape ``(2048, 48)``.

LANCE_VAE_DOWNSAMPLE_SPATIAL = 16

#: Schedule points Lance samples beyond ``num_inference_steps``; mirrors
#: ``LanceBagel._denoise_schedule_extra_step``, which a test pins.
LANCE_SCHEDULE_EXTRA_POINTS = 1

#: Qwen2.5-VL head-dimension split across the (t, h, w) rotary axes; the
#: rollout sets the same list on the language model's ``rope_scaling``.
LANCE_MROPE_SECTION = (16, 24, 24)

#: Lance's rollout CFG defaults coincide with the BAGEL FlowGRPO ones
#: (``cfg_text_scale=4.0``, global renorm); keep a separate name so the two
#: can diverge without silently changing BAGEL.

    Lance differs from BAGEL twice over.  The shift is 3.5 rather than 3.0,
    and the schedule carries one more point: ``LanceBagel`` sets
    ``_denoise_schedule_extra_step``, so ``Bagel.generate_image`` samples
    ``num_steps + 1`` points and runs ``num_steps`` Euler steps, where BAGEL
    samples ``num_steps`` and runs one fewer.  Building BAGEL's count here
    would leave the trainer one sigma short of the trajectory the rollout
    recorded, and every sigma would sit on a different grid.

    Args:
        scheduler: Scheduler to configure in place.
        num_steps: Number of denoising steps the rollout performs.
        shift: Timestep shift; defaults to Lance's 3.5.
