# Lance FlowGRPO training (text-to-image)

Last updated: 09/18/2026.

[Lance](https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/Lance) is a 3B unified
multimodal model that covers image and video understanding, generation and
editing in one autoregressive + diffusion model.  It is BAGEL-lineage:
vllm-omni's `LancePipeline` inherits `BagelPipeline` and overrides only model
construction, so the verl-omni side reuses BAGEL's MoT training module and
adapters and overrides only what the checkpoint changes.

This milestone covers **`t2i` RL with LoRA on the generation expert**.  The
video path (`t2v`, `i2v`, editing) is tracked separately; see
[RFC #222](https://github.com/verl-project/verl-omni/issues/222).

## What differs from BAGEL

| Aspect | BAGEL-7B-MoT | Lance_3B |
|---|---|---|
| Transformer | Qwen2-MoT | identical (inherited) |
| Latent | BAGEL AE, 16 channels, 8x downsample, 2x2 latent patch | Wan2.2 VAE, 48 channels, 16x downsample, no latent patch |
| `vae2llm` | `(hidden, 64)` | `(2048, 48)` |
| `latent_pos_embed` | `(max_latent_size**2, hidden)`, 32 grid | `(4096, 2048)`, 64 grid |
| Sigma shift | 3.0 | **3.5** |
| Config | `config.json` with `llm_config` / `vae_config` | `Lance_3B/llm_config.json` plus constants |
| Checkpoint | `ema.safetensors` | `Lance_3B/model.safetensors` |
| RoPE | 1-D, one position for the whole image block | mRoPE, per-token `(t, h, w)` over the latent grid |

The last row is the one that reaches furthest.  BAGEL gives the image block a
single position and lets `latent_pos_embed` carry the layout; Lance keeps
`rope_scaling` on the language model and `LanceBagel.prepare_vae_latent` gives
latent `(hi, wi)` the position `(P + 1, P + 1 + hi, P + 1 + wi)`.  The trainer
has to build the same positions and the same rotary basis, or the log-probs it
recomputes are taken under a different basis than the rollout used and the
importance ratio is not 1 even before the first update.
`tests/pipelines/test_lance_flowgrpo_on_cpu.py` compares both against the
rollout's own `_per_token_mrope_for_vae_latent` and `BagelRotaryEmbedding`.

## Prerequisites

- Install VeRL-Omni (see the [installation guide](../../../docs/start/install.md)).

- 4 GPUs. Run commands from the repository root.

  "3B" counts one expert: `llm_config.json` gives 36 layers at hidden 2048 with
  an 11008 MLP, and the MoT carries a text and a generation copy of every
  layer, so the trainer holds roughly 5.9B parameters (about 12 GB in bf16)
  and the rollout holds its own copy.

- Download the checkpoint bundle:

  ```bash
  huggingface-cli download bytedance-research/Lance --local-dir ~/models/bytedance-research/Lance
  ```

  Point `model.path` at the bundle root; the adapters resolve the `Lance_3B`
  subdirectory themselves.  `model.tokenizer_path` is the one path that does
  not get resolved for you, and the released tokenizer needs two repairs: it
  lives inside `Lance_3B/` rather than at the bundle root (a run aimed at the
  root fails on a partial tokenizer `AutoTokenizer` cannot build), and it
  designates neither `eos_token` nor `pad_token`, so the agent loop fails the
  first time it pads a batch of prompts.  The data prep below writes a
  repaired copy next to the parquet and the recipe points there; the released
  checkpoint is left untouched.

## PickScore training

PickScore scores image-text alignment with a
[CLIP-based model](https://huggingface.co/yuvalkirstain/PickScore_v1).  The
reward function lives in `verl_omni/utils/reward_score/pickscore_reward.py`,
so there is no separate reward deployment and the GPU is shared between the
actor and the reward.

### Prepare the dataset

The raw PickScore dataset (`train.txt` / `test.txt`) comes from the
[flow_grpo repository](https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo/tree/main/dataset/pickscore).

```bash
export WORKSPACE=${WORKSPACE:-$HOME}

python3 examples/flowgrpo_trainer/data_process/lance_pickscore.py \
  --model_path ~/models/bytedance-research/Lance \
  --input_dir ~/data/pickscore \
  --output_dir $WORKSPACE/data/pickscore/lance
```

This produces `$WORKSPACE/data/pickscore/lance/train.parquet` and
`test.parquet`.

### Run LoRA training

```bash
bash examples/flowgrpo_trainer/lance/run_lance_pickscore_lora.sh
```

The recipe mirrors
[`run_bagel_pickscore_lora.sh`](../bagel/run_bagel_pickscore_lora.sh): LoRA
rank 64 on the `*_moe_gen` projections, `noise_level=1.3`, SDE window `size=2`
over `[0, 7]`, and 15 denoising steps for rollouts.  Validation runs at 30
steps rather than the BAGEL recipe's 50: 50 is what BAGEL's pipeline defaults
to, and Lance's own default is 30 (`LANCE_DEFAULTS.num_timesteps`), so
validation samples the model the way it is meant to be sampled.  The rollout
count stays at 15, which keeps the SDE window over the same fraction of the
trajectory as the BAGEL recipe puts it over.  Otherwise only the checkpoint,
the deploy config and
`+actor_rollout_ref.model.architecture=OmniLanceForConditionalGeneration`
change.

### Checking rollout and trainer agree

The FlowGRPO importance ratio is only unbiased when the log-probs the trainer
recomputes match the ones the rollout recorded.  Nothing has moved yet on the
first update of a step, so if the two agree `actor/ratio_mean` is 1.0 and
`actor/ppo_kl` and `actor/pg_clipfrac` are about zero.  Read those on the
first step: a schedule or CFG mismatch pushes the ratio off 1 and starts the
clipping immediately, before any reward signal exists.  Two things diverge
from BAGEL and are the first places to look: the sigma schedule (Lance shifts
by 3.5 and samples one more point than BAGEL) and the rotary positions (Lance
gives the latents per-token `(h, w)` where BAGEL gives the block one scalar).

## Not covered here

- `t2v` / `i2v` / image and video editing: these need the 3-D latent position
  embedding and the temporal mRoPE axis, plus the Wan2.2 multi-frame decode in
  the reward path.  The 2-D positions this adds are the image case of the same
  construction, so the video case extends `build_position_ids` rather than
  replacing it.
- `x2t_image` / `x2t_video`: autoregressive token generation, so they belong to
  the AR/VLM RL path rather than the diffusion FlowGRPO adapter.
